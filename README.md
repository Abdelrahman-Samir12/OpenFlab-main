Formal Languages and Automata (FLA) courses often involve a lot
of mathematical rigor in the form of notation and proofs. Many
instructors would also like to engage studentsâ€™ computational skills
when studying course topics. However, this requires significant
infrastructure support in the form of simulators for the various
models of computation. Further, it can be difficult for instructors to
design and grade practical implementation problems. OpenFLAP
provides a comprehensive collection of finite automata and grammar
simulators. It can automatically generate visualizations for a
given automata executing on selected input. OpenFLAP provides
infrastructure for automatically testing the behavior of a given
automata against a test suite of input strings.We describe how FLA
instructors can use these OpenFLAP features to easily create a wide
variety of exercises appropriate for FLA courses, and which are then
automatically graded in the way that small programming exercises
would automatically be graded by appropriate software. Thus, students
can gain access to as many practice exercises as the instructor
believes necessary, and receive immediate automated feedback on
their work. Students can also see automatically generated visualizations
that demonstrate the detailed behavior of various models
of computation on their choice of input strings.
